At CAP, I worked as a Data Visualization Developer, building around 25 interactives during my time there.

My goal was to create a consistent identity across graphics, a library of reusable charts, and a build process that simplifies creating and deploying ad-hoc graphics.

Examples:
[The Hidden Cost of a Failing Child Care System](https://interactives.americanprogress.org/childcarecosts/)&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;[The Future of America's Nuclear Arsenal](http://interactives.americanprogress.org/future-of-nukes/)&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;[Blending American Youth](http://interactives.americanprogress.org/projects/2016/blending-american-youth/)
