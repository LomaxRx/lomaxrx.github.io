In 2018, I led the design, development and rollout of a refreshed <a target="\_blank" href="https://www.newamerica.org">newamerica.org</a>. Our designer and I set out to reimagine the look, feel, navigation, and information architecture of the think tank’s 30+ policy team’s pages and publications.

This wasn’t just a mere reskinning. We also completely overhauled and streamlined the organization’s publishing process, reducing the time from final copy to publication by half while also adding support for the full-text of policy papers online. We automated the layout of 90% of the organization’s PDFs ([read more](/projects/policy-paper-automation/)), increased support for custom interactive data visualizations, and rebuilt the site’s front-end from the ground up with react.
