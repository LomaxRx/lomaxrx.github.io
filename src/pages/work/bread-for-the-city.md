Bread for the City is a human services nonprofit in DC. I was initially hired in their medical clinic as a Data Analyst, building SQL reports for their MS Access database.

I ultimately helped the organization move from Access to Salesforce, redesigned their intake process, automated monthly and yearly reports, and built data visualizations that mapped their services across DC neighborhoods and charted monthly trends in a dashboard (right).

I have so many stories to tell about this place. A truely formative work experience.
